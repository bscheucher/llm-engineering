       "- **It’s a liar.** Most \"vanilla\" things are just sugar + artificial flavor. Real vanilla beans are complex and floral, but no one’s actually tasting that in their soft-serve.  \n",

A sandwich, by definition, is \"food items, such as meats, cheeses, or vegetables, placed between two slices of bread.\" And what is a hot dog bun, if not a form of bread? The encased meat is the filling, nestled snugly between those fluffy buns. Ergo, the hot dog fulfills the essential sandwich criteria. I won't hear any arguments to the contrary!\n",

The nuance, depth, and richness of the written word can be challenging to capture on screen. But I would argue that a skilled filmmaker can still do justice to a beloved novel, highlighting the core themes and emotions in a visually captivating way. *The Great Gatsby* is a complex case, where the stylistic flourishes may have overshadowed the deeper substance.

       "Oh, look at you, fully committing to your *erroneous* positions! Let’s dismantle your misguided arguments one by one, shall we? \n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Pineapple on Pizza**: You call it a \"flavor revelation.\" I call it a crime against pizza. Sweet does not belong on savory! It’s not a tropical vacation; it’s a culinary confusion! That “pop of color” you love? It’s just a distraction from the fact that you can’t handle real pizza toppings. And who doesn’t want a slice of heaven without a fruit salad ruin? Your taste buds need a serious re-evaluation!\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Hot Dog as Sandwich**: Oh, please. Since when does a bun qualify as \"two slices of bread\"? Not to mention the hot dog isn’t nestled; it’s crammed in there and doesn't qualify for a sandwich award! You’re basically redefining language with this argument. If we apply your logic, I could call an open-faced turkey dinner a sandwich too! And spoiler alert: no one’s doing that.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Books vs. Movies**: You bring up *The Shawshank Redemption*? Sure, it’s a good movie, but it doesn’t change the fact that too many adaptations butcher the original material. Just because a few filmmakers manage to sneak in some decent interpretations doesn’t make the trend any less disastrous overall. Not every director can pull off what they did. Even if we look at *To Kill a Mockingbird*, it’s still widely criticized for leaving out key elements from the book! \n",
       "\n",
       "So there you go—you’ve just walked into a minefield of culinary, linguistic, and cinematic chaos, and I’m just getting started! What’s your *next* argument? Let’s see how deep the rabbit hole goes! 🐇💣\n"

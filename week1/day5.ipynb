      "✨ Learned positional tokens FTW: For compact models, learned positional tokens significantly outperform raw text tokens, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.\n",
      "✨ System prompts and special tokens are key: Introducing system prompts and dedicated media intro/outro tokens significantly boosted our compact VLM’s performance—especially for video tasks.\n",
      "✨ Less CoT, more efficiency: Turns out, too much Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data actually hurts performance in small models. They dumb\n",
      "✨ Longer videos, better results: Increasing video length during training enhanced performance on both video and image tasks.\n",
